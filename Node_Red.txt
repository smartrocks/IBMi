Node Red

Node Red is a visual programming tool for wiring together hardware devices, 
APIs and online services in new and interesting ways. It provides a browser-based editor 
that makes it easy to wire together flows using the wide range of nodes in the palette 
that can be deployed to its runtime in a single-click.  Node-RED is built on Node.js, 
taking full advantage of its event-driven, non-blocking model. 
This makes it ideal to run at the edge of the network on low-cost hardware such as the 
Raspberry Pi as well as in the cloud.                       

Installation
    npm install -g --unsafe-perm node-red
        The -g flag installs Node-RED globally so that it can be run from any directory.
        The --unsafe-perm flag is sometimes needed on Linux systems to avoid permission issues.

Starting Node Red
    node-red
        This will start Node-RED as a background service and display the process ID (PID) 
        of the started process. This is useful if you need to kill the process later on.

Access Node-RED Editor
    Open a web browser and go to http://localhost:1880. 
    This is the default address where the Node-RED editor is accessible. 
    If you're running Node-RED on a different machine, replace localhost with the IP address 
    or hostname of that machine.

Explore Node-RED
    Once the Node-RED editor is open in your browser, you can start building flows, 
    connecting nodes, and exploring the available nodes from the palette.

Node.js 

Setup
    Step 1: Install Node.js on IBM i
        Ensure that Node.js is installed on your IBM i system. 

        Use the yum command to install Node.js:
            yum install nodejs20   (or most currect version supported on the IBM i)

            or

Hello World

Node.js has a build in web server so you don't need to run Apache or NGINX,
        although it is common when running in production to use a front end web server on top of Node.js.  

To make use of the Node.js web server, we use a module called express.js. express.js is a free and open-source 
framework that makes using the Node.js web APIs a ton easier by wrapping them in simpler functions we use.

To install express.js (‘express’ for short), we need to use the Node Package Manager (npm for short). 
npm is installed along with Node.js and is available to use on the command line (just like the node command).

Install express to your project / working directory:
    1) Open your terminal (either from the command line or VS Code).
    2) Make sure your working directory is your project directory.
            use mkdir to create a new directory
    3) First, we run command  
            npm init    (or  npm init -y  to accept all the default values)
        This creates a package.json file. 
        You only need to do this if it’s a new project and the package.json does not exist. 
        This file tracks information about your project, like the name and dependencies.
    4) Use npm install express to import express into your application directory.
            npm install express   // installs to folder node_modules

Run your node application
    node app.js     // the node application entry point is app.js or index.js

Create a Node.js Project

Create a new directory for your Node.js project:
    mkdir ~/nodeSolutions
    mkdir ~/nodeSolutions/getCountryInfo
    cd myproject
